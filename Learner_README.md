<i> Assuming you have the rust compiler installed(c++compiler files for vs code or other requirements installed)</i>

<i>Quite a few people should already know basic programming enough to skip this section but this is attempting to leave no stone unturned as this guide will go up to far more advanced topics.</i>

> - Go to your git enabled IDE or download the zip.
> - Go to the src folder in the IDE.
> - Open the "main.rs" and "print.rs" module.
> - Remove the comments characters "//" in the main.rs file for the "mod print.rs" import statement and the function call in main "print::run()";
> - Save the file.
> - Open a new terminal window in the ide or command prompt and navigate to the active directory you cloned this git repo into.
> - Type "cargo run", and press enter.
> - The commented out section should introduce the concept with the title namesake and at the end of the file point you to the next concept to learn.<br>
> <i>Good Luck!!</i>
