# Rust_Crash_Course
## A set of modules explaining how the rust programming language works and how it may be different from other languages within a given module

### Please feel free to contribute with separate modules that you feel are helpful or explain a key concept well!! 

If contributing, Please use the established scheme of creating a separate .rs/.env/ cargo.toml/ file and calling it from main. <br>
Please also use friendly variable names that make sense (try harder than simply using "foo-bar" everywhere by using variable names
that mirror a similar analogy that really drives the point home<br>
 - please comment a summary of code 
 - please comment datatypes, borrows, and ownership quirks
 - Please comment the flow of code if giving an extensive example with multiple modules. 
 - Please comment definitions of unique struct/enum types<br>
<i>**If giving an error handling explanation, Please include the error code and the working(compiling) version of the code**</i>
### <b><i>Please review code one last time prior to submission</i></b>

<u>As always, thank you for your contributions~</u>
