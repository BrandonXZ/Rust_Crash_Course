# Rust_Crash_Course
A set of modules explaining how the rust programming language works and how it may be different from other languages within a given module


Please feel free to contribute with separate modules that you feel are helpful or explain a key concept well!! 

If contributing, Please use the established scheme of creating a separate .rs/.env/ cargo.toml/ file and calling it from main. 
Please also use friendly variable names that make sense (try harder than simply using "foo-bar" everywhere by using variable names
that mirror a similar analogy that really drives the point home
please comment a summary of code 
please comment datatypes, borrows, and ownership quirks
Please comment the flow of code if giving an extensive example with multiple modules. 
Please comment definitions of unique struct/enum types
If giving an error handling explanation, Please include the error code and the working(compiling) version of the code
Please review code one last time prior to submission

As always, thank you for your contributions~
